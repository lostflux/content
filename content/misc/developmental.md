## Introduction

What is the context around "developed" and "developing" nations,
and why should we care?

## History of Technological Developments

Technology has made everything infinitely more efficient, but that wasn't always the case.
Briefly, we look at the history of and pioneers in technology.

## The Technology Gap

In today's world, a nation's economic sustainability is increasingly
dependent on its ability to develop or otherwise acquire and adapt
technology to its local needs. However, there is a significant
disparity in accessibility (or ease of access) to technology between
developed and developing nations.
How did this disparity arise, and what are the implications?

## Solutions to Technology Needs

What are some avenues for developing nations
addressing the technology gap and
meeting their immediate technology needs?

### Technology Transfer

One of the ways for nations to meet their technology needs
is through importing technology from other nations.
What are the challenges and advantages of this approach?

### Native Technology Development

Another way for nations to meet their technology needs
is by developing it themselves.
What are the hindrances and advantages of this approach?
More importantly, what are some successful examples?

## Future Trends and Caveats

Where can developing nations expect to be in the next 10-20 years,
and what can they expect?
