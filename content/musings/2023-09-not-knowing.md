title: not knowing
description: |
  Knowing nothing is the first step to knowing anything.
  Yet, it is often frowned upon to admit that you know nothing.
  In the Socratic Dialogues, Socrates posits that it is worse
  of oneself to think they know that which they do not know
  than to admit that they do not know.

That which I do not know,  
neither do I think I know.

[^nothingness]: Many of the earliest philosophers, including [Parminedes][parminedes] and [Plato][plato],
  refuted [_creatio ex nihilo_][ex-nihilo], the premise of conception from nothing.
  That all existent things must either have _always_ existed,
  or _must have a cause_ &mdash; some other existent thing or things that predated it.
  The idea of nothingness was absurd.
  This school of thought proves a refuge for many a political institution, religious doctrine,
  philosophical school of thought, and even scientific argument. <br/> <br/>
