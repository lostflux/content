title: not knowing
description: |
  Knowing nothing is the first step to knowing anything.
  Yet, it is often frowned upon to admit that you know nothing.
  In the Socratic Dialogues, Socrates posits that it is worse
  of oneself to think they know that which they do not know
  than to admit that they do not know.

That which I do not know,  
neither do I think I know.
