In the name of the [Galactic Spirit][galactic-spirit], I submit myself, a holy brother of [The Foundation][the-foundation], to its will.
Let my eyes, which are the Spirit's eyes, look only forward to the future which the Spirit has divined.
Let my heart, which is the Spirit's heart, join its humble beating with the great rhythm of the Spirit.

_**Guide me through the darkness,
and together we will shorten the darkness.**_

Is that... a _prayer_?  
Is a god who presides over killers truly a god?
