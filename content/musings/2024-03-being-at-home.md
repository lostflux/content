![The past is always tense, the future perfect.](zadie-smith.jpg)

I think of myself as somebody not at home.  
Not at home anywhere, not at home ever.  
Not comfortable with themselves in their supposed lives,
in their nation, in their bodies, in everything.

There are lots of people who feel very certain about themselves,
where they are born, what it means.
I've never felt that.
I don't think of that as a negative feeling.
To me, it's creative.
It's the people who feel that they belong very strongly who put fear in me, to be honest.
