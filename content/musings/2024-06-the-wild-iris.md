A handful of times a lifetime, if you are lucky, an experience opens a trapdoor in your psyche with its almost unbearable beauty and strangeness, its discomposing unlikeness to anything you have known before. Down, down you go into the depths of the unconscious, dark and fertile with the terror and longing that make for suffering, the surrender that makes for the end of suffering, not in resignation but in faith. It is then that the still, small voice of the soul begins to sing; it is then that the trapdoor becomes a portal into a life larger, truer, and more possible — a kind of rebirth.

Nobel laureate Louise Glück (April 22, 1943–October 13, 2023) captures the essence of such experiences, the way they sober us to being mortal and to being alive, with an image of piercing originality in the title poem of her 1992 collection [The Wild Iris](https://www.themarginalian.org/).

At the end of my suffering  
there was a door.  
:br Hear me out: that which you call death  
I remember.  
:br Overhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.  
Then nothing. The weak sun  
flickered over the dry surface.  
:br It is terrible to survive  
as consciousness  
buried in the dark earth.  
:br Then it was over: **that which you fear, being  
a soul and unable  
to speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth  
bending a little**. And what I took to be  
birds darting in low shrubs.  
:br You who do not remember  
passage from the other world  
I tell you I could speak again: **whatever  
returns from oblivion returns  
to find a voice:**  
:br from the center of my life came  
a great fountain, deep blue  
shadows on azure sea water.
