  A short poem on the human condition
  and how our determined-ness eventually digs us
  into our own disasters.

that's what we were: [nowhere people](http://www.nowherepeople.org/).  
born to a pretty anyhow world.  
born to nightmares.  
and to dreams worse than nightmares.

a haunted fate.

but who are we now? a disaster of our own making.
