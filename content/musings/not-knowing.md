That which I do not know,  
neither do I think I know.

[^nothingness]: Many of the earliest philosophers, including [Parminedes][parminedes] and [Plato][plato],
  refuted [_creatio ex nihilo_][ex-nihilo], the premise of conception from nothing.
  That all existent things must either have _always_ existed,
  or _must have a cause_ &mdash; some other existent thing or things that predated it.
  The idea of nothingness was absurd.
  This school of thought proves a refuge for many a political institution, religious doctrine,
  philosophical school of thought, and even scientific argument. <br/> <br/>
