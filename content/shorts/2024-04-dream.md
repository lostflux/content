## Dare to dream $\quad \mapsto \quad$ dare to create

To dream is to imagine a world not confined by the present
but enlightened by the possibility of the future.

To create, then, is to bring substance to the ethereal,
form to the formless. It is the courage to step
beyond the known, to dance on the edge of uncertainty,
and to risk failing in the pursuit of something
truly original, something truly meaningful.
