**_Enjoy your pain._**

Don't leave it. Don't hide it.
Certainly don't look away: pain can be the greatest moment of your life.
After all, pain is the only true thing in the world.
Everything before pain is a story,
everything after is another story.
Joy, hope, ecstasy, love, dread, fear, anger, sadness&mdash;all stories.
But that burning and unrelenting suffering is life without a filter.
It shows you who you really are; you only
have to be willing to attend.

A workout that burns your legs alive.  
A failure that feels like the end.  
A heartbreak that takes more than you have.

_You have at least two choices in these moments.
To shut the pain out,
avoid it,
quit it if you can.
Or to let it give you what you need.
To feel it all.
To learn your pain and everything it has for and against you.
[True pain is either the end of your story
or the source of unlimited rage and energy
to create what you're truly capable of.][real]_
