  So much fear of missing out...  
  Rather embrace the **joy** of missing out.  
  **Life’s better when you’re missing the stuff that doesn’t matter anyway.**

There's this absurdity called **showing up**
that everyone is obsessed with.[^1]

There are many tropes to showing up, exemplified by the following rhetoric:

- _**Success is showing up every day.**_
- _**Show up and you're halfway there.**_
- _**Show up as the _real_ you!**_
- _**I showed up for a year and look at me now!**_
- _**I am not [\[insert fancy title\]]{style="font-style: normal;"} yet, but I would imagine it as simple as showing up!**_
- This is unemphasized.
- ...

Sure. We get it.  
**Showing up matters.**

---

It is not the **_when_**, **_where_**, **_how_**, much rather the **_what_**
that we should most be worrying about.
Then&mdash;and only then&mdash;should we worry about authenticity, consistency, and the rest.
After all, one may show up dutifully, or sensationally, or authentically,
for the wrong things.

> Show up for, and do, what you intend to do. -->

As for the other things, the ones beyond out interests and intentions?
Aren't they exciting?

> I feel that I need to show up for everything that comes my way

There's a reason you don't see people like [Max Verstappen][max] at every single
race event in the world.
They don't do more things "well".
They do less things _incredibly well_.
And so should we.
Embrace the joy of missing out.
