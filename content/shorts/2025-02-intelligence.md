  The only true test of intelligence is  
  if you get what you want out of life.

The only true test of intelligence is  
if you get what you want out of life.

::

It has to start with figuring out what you want.

And not what you think you want,  
or what you think you _should_ want,  
or what you think you _should think_ you want,  
or...

_**What you truly want.**_

Dear; sometimes it takes a lifetime to work that out.

I may not have this... _thing_ entirely figured out myself,  
but here's what I ask myself every day:

- _What is the most important thing I needed to accomplish today?_
- _Did I do my best?_
- _What did I change from yesterday? What do I need to change?_
- _Am I healthy?_
