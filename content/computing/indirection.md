We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection.[^indirection]

_...except the problem of too much indirection_.[^too-much-indirection]  
And [too much indirection][semantic-compression] is the third root of all evil.[^roots-of-evil]

[^indirection]:           Indirection refers to dispatch of communications via an intermediary.
  The intermediary is the cause of indirection, and is (strictly) an entity capable of examining a message
  and making a decision regarding it (e.g. on whether to forward it or answer it, or on where to forward it, etc.).
  There may be a chain of such intermediaries along a communications path, each constituting one level of indirection.

[^too-much-indirection]:   For instance, to fix a slow storage system, one may reckon:  
      - To add [caching][caching], an indirection of access. On each request, the cache manager decides whether to
        serve the request from the cache or to forward it to the storage system.
      - To [parallelize][parallel-systems] and [distribute][distributed-systems] access, an indirection over a [_load balancer_][load-balancer].
        On each request, the load balancer decides which storage node to forward the request to.
      - To reduce iterated strength[^3] &mdash; such as by refactoring logic out of loops or functions when computed effects
        can be shared across iterations or function calls (a sort of caching?).
      - At this scale of complexity, one perhaps needs yet another indirection in the form of a [compiler][compiler]
        (even [real programmers][real-programmers] need a compiler!).

    As the system complexity explodes, one reckons the collective ought to be refactored into smaller,
    _"atomic"_ components, each abstracting away specific complexities and exposing a reasonable [API][api]
    for the next level of indirection to consume.
    But the complexity of each subsystem soon matches that of the original system.
    **Voil√†: the original pain is rediscovered, and recursion[^too-much-indirection] beckons.**

[^roots-of-evil]:                     The first two are _[premature optimization][premature-optimization]_, [_atrocious naming_][naming-things],
                          and [_off-by-one errors_][off-by-one].

[^3]:                     Made up our own terminology, have we?
